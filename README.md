# JavaScript Functions Tutorial

This repository is dedicated to demonstrating different ways of declaring functions in JavaScript. The included examples help illustrate the use of function declarations, function expressions, and arrow functions.

## Content

- **Function Declarations**: These are the traditional functions in JavaScript. The advantage of a function declaration is that it is hoisted (its scope is lifted to the top of other code), so you can use it before it is declared in your code. In our example, `avg4` is a function declaration that calculates the average of four numbers.

- **Function Expressions**: A JavaScript function can also be defined using an expression. Function expressions are not hoisted, unlike function declarations, and therefore cannot be used before they are defined. In this repo, `avg3` is a function expression that calculates the average of three numbers.

- **Arrow Functions**: Introduced in ES6, arrow functions offer a shorter syntax compared to function expressions. They also have their own distinctions concerning `this` keyword but that's beyond the scope of this repository. `avg2` is an example of an arrow function that calculates the average of two numbers.

## How to Use

You can clone this repository to your local machine to observe the behavior of these different function types.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/javascript-functions-tutorial.git
```
Then, simply run the functions.js file in any JavaScript environment (like Node.js or a browser console).
Remember to replace `https://github.com/yourusername/javascript-functions-tutorial.git` with the actual URL of your repository.
